          <h1>Student Representative Testimonial Quote</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>“I am so proud and honored to say that I have served as the State Board of Education Student Representative and the Co-Chair of the Student Advisory Committee. As a student representative, I am the liaison and voice between the student population of the District of Columbia and policymakers for education. This role has helped me develop tremendously and has allowed me to discuss how my education is affected by decisions being made. I have also become more passionate in being sure that student voices are heard. My peers have also put trust in me to be the voice of our education. I have worked with students from so many DC high schools to discuss the goals we expect to meet as a district. We have also discussed having equitable opportunities and resources for all of our education. I have been the leader of creating a mentorship program, leading meetings, sharing correspondence via email, and interaction with some leading policymakers.”</p>
